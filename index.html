                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This website is dedicated to my interest in outerspace, and all the mysteriousness that goes along with it. I've been fascinated with outerspace every since I was a child and I hope that I am able to witness and even be apart of advancements
                    to better understand what exactly makes up the vastness we call space. As someone who wonders about the why and how of natural phenomenas, outerspace is the perfect subject for me. Join me in exploring topics that interest me the most.
                    Enjoy geek! </p>

                <h2>Blackholes</h2>
                <p>Black hole are region in space where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. It is formed when a massive star collapses under its own weight, creating a singularity - a point of infinite
                    density and zero volume. The event horizon is the point of no return, beyond which anything that enters is inevitably pulled towards the singularity. Black holes are invisible, but their presence can be detected by observing their
                    effect on nearby matter or through their gravitational influence on other objects in space. </p>

                <h2>Multiverses</h2>
                <p>The multiverse is a theoretical concept in physics and cosmology that suggests the existence of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws, constants, and properties. In this hypothesis, our observable universe is just
                    one among many, possibly infinite, parallel universes that exist alongside each other in a vast, complex, and ever-expanding cosmic landscape. The idea of the multiverse has been proposed as a way to explain various phenomena in physics,
                    such as the fine-tuning of the universe's parameters and the nature of quantum mechanics. </p>
